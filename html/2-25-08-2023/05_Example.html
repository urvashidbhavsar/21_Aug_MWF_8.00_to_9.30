        <!-- <abbr> abbrivation tag which is show html tooltip -->
        <abbr title="Cascading stylesheet">CSS</abbr> is designed to enable the separation of <u style="color: green;">content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts</u>.<sup><a href="">[3]</a></sup> This
        separation can improve content accessibility; provide more <b><em>flexibility</em></b> and control in the specification of presentation
        characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
        which reduces <code><strong>complexity</strong></code> and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the
        page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
    </p>
    <p>
        The name <del>cascading</del> comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule
        matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is <mark>predictable</mark>.
